			 *	The enemy’s Score values are secretly assigned and the player chooses his for the turn.
	 		 *
			 *	2nd Step: Reaction Step
		   	 *	Both character’s Score values for the turn are revealed. The character with the lowest Offense Score, 
		   	 *  if any, must chose whether or not to forfeit his Offense Score (i.e. assign its value to 0). 
		   	 *  The Enemy A.I. will never do so.
	         *
			 *	3rd Step: Action Step
			 *	The action’s Stamina cost of both charaters is deduced from its current Stamina.
	         *
			 *	4th Step: Attack Step
			 *	if characters share the same Offense Score
			 *	Both characters are considered to be attacking at the same time. Both THS are used independently to check 
			 *  for the sucess of each character’s attack.
	         *
			 *	if characters do NOT share the same Offense Score
			 *	The character with the highest Offense Score is considered to be attacking first. His THS is used to determine if the attack was successful. 
			 *  If the attack was not sucessful, then and only then, second character’s THS is used to determine if his attack was sucessful. 
			 *
			 *	5th Step: Damage Step
			 *	If a character was hit by an attack, it dies and the encounter is over. Otherwise, the a new Turn begins until one of the characters is slain.
